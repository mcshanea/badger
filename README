This is an example application containing the following:

A badge system.
A game which allows users to guess a number between 1..100.
Once the game expires and a person wins, they will be awarded points.
The game itself (hundred) will award more points if a user "defeats" more players.
Activity will be shown using HTML5 (currently only supported in Chrome) push.
More points earn different badges.
A person can claim entitlements based on their current badge.
